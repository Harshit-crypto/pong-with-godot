# Pong with Godot

A simple Pong game made with Godot and GDScript to help me learn signals.

This game was made with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) v3.5. To run and work on the game, you need to open the project on Godot. Click on the play icon at the top right of the editor or press `F5`.
